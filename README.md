# Oauth-11870

Here is a sample showing how to use [11870](https://11870.com/) Oauth with PHP, should anyone be stumped by the [documentation](https://sites.google.com/site/api11870/api/authentication).

AppToken and AppSecret should be changed, in case default ones are revoked. It can be done by creating a new app : [https://11870.com/{UserName}/apps](https://11870.com/UserName/apps).
